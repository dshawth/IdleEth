> Automatically mine Ethereum when your system idles

This program helps you get the most out of your system.  It automatically starts mining Ethereum using [Ethminer](https://github.com/ethereum-mining/ethminer) when you are not using your computer and automatically stops mining when you resume.

## Updates

I am just getting this off the ground.  The initial compiled beta is included in releases.  The source will follow in the next few hours.

This project is starting in [AutoHotkey](https://autohotkey.com/) but will likely move to a more efficient language in the future.
