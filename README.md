> Automatically mine Ethereum when your system idles

This program helps you get the most out of your system.  It automatically starts mining Ethereum using [Ethminer](https://github.com/ethereum-mining/ethminer) with [Ethermine](https://ethermine.org/) when you are not using your computer and automatically stops mining when you resume.  Designed with the Windows 10 gamer in mind.
