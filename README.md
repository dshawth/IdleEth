> Automatically mine Ethereum when your system idles

This program helps you get the most out of your system.  It automatically starts mining Ethereum using [Ethminer](https://github.com/ethereum-mining/ethminer) when you are not using your computer and automatically stops mining when you resume.

I am just getting this off the ground, but uploaded the initial compiled beta.

This project is starting in [AutoHotkey](https://autohotkey.com/) but will likely move to C# in the future.
